# 🔐 Software Requirements for Login Page

## 📝 Project Overview

The login page is a crucial part of the website, enabling users to securely access their accounts. The system must authenticate users based on their email and password. Upon successful authentication, the user will be directed to the dashboard. In case of any input errors (incorrect email or password), appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

1. **Login Form**
   - The login form should contain two fields: `Email` and `Password`.
   - A **Submit** button for sending the login request.
   - A **Forgot Password?** link to allow users to reset their password.

2. **Email Field**
   - Must accept valid email addresses only.
   - The input should be validated to ensure it follows the format `example@domain.com`.
   - 🔴 **Error Message**: "Please enter a valid email address" if an invalid email format is provided.

3. **Password Field**
   - Should accept a password with a minimum length of **8 characters**.
   - Should allow a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - 🔴 **Error Message**: "Password must be at least 8 characters long" if a shorter password is provided.

4. **Authentication Logic**
   - Upon submitting the correct email and password, the user is redirected to their dashboard.
   - If either the email or password is incorrect, an error message should be displayed.
   - 🔴 **Error Message**: "Invalid email or password" when the authentication fails.

5. **Security**
   - Passwords must be **hashed** before being stored in the database.
   - No sensitive data (such as passwords) should be exposed in network requests.
   - The system should block users after **three consecutive failed login attempts**, with an error message:
     > "Your account has been temporarily locked due to multiple failed login attempts."

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**
   - The login page should be **responsive** and work across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
   - Loading times should be optimized for a seamless user experience.

2. **Performance**
   - The system should authenticate users within **2 seconds** of submitting their credentials.
   - It should handle up to **100 concurrent login requests** efficiently without lag or delay.

3. **Compatibility**
   - The login functionality should work across all major browsers (**Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, **Edge**).
   - It should be compatible with common operating systems (**Windows**, **macOS**, **iOS**, **Android**).

4. **Security**
   - The login process should be secured using **HTTPS** to protect user credentials from being intercepted.
   - Implement a **CAPTCHA** system to prevent brute-force attacks after multiple failed login attempts.

## ⚠️ Error Handling

1. **General Error**
   - If any server-side error occurs during the authentication process, the system should display:
     > "An error occurred. Please try again later."

## 🔮 Future Scope

1. **Social Media Login Integration**
   - Support login through third-party providers such as **Google**, **Facebook**, or **GitHub** for enhanced user experience.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Implement an additional layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity through a second factor (SMS, email, or app-based authentication) after providing their credentials.
