# 🔐 Login Page Testing Project

This project focuses on the manual testing of a **Login Page** for a website. The goal is to ensure that the login functionality is secure, robust, and handles both valid and invalid user inputs effectively. The system should allow users to log in with correct credentials and show appropriate error messages when incorrect or incomplete data is provided.

## 🌟 Key Features Tested

- **🔑 Authentication**: Verify login with valid and invalid credentials.
- **⚠️ Error Handling**: Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed for incorrect inputs.
- **🔒 Security**: Test for secure handling of passwords and sensitive data.
- **🛠️ Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like special characters, empty fields, and long inputs.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **📄 `Requirements`**: Contains the functional and non-functional requirements.
- **📝 `Test Plan`**: A structured approach to testing, including test strategy and schedule.
- **✅ `Test Cases`**: Detailed test cases covering various login scenarios.
- **🐞 `Bug Reports`**: Documentation of any issues encountered during testing.
- **📊 `Test Reports`**: Results and analysis of the test executions.
