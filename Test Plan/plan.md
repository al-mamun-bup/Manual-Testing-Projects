### 1. **Objective**

The objective of this test plan is to validate the login page functionality, ensuring it meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements. The login page should authenticate users, handle errors gracefully, and maintain security standards.

---

### 2. **Scope**

The scope of testing includes the login functionality, error handling, and security measures for sensitive data (e.g., passwords). The login page must be tested across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent user experience.

---

### 3. **Inclusions**

The following items are included within the scope of this test plan:
- Authentication of users with valid credentials.
- Error handling for invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect email format or password).
- Security checks for password hashing and session management.
- Usability testing on different browsers and devices.
- Performance testing under load conditions.

---

### 4. **Test Environments**

Testing will be conducted in the following environments:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- **Devices**: Desktop (Windows, macOS), Mobile (iOS, Android).
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10, macOS, Android, iOS.

---

### 5. **Defect Reporting Procedure**

All defects will be logged in [Defect Management Tool, e.g., JIRA]. Each defect will be assigned a severity level and tracked through the following stages:
1. **New**: Defect reported and logged.
2. **Assigned**: Defect assigned to a developer.
3. **In Progress**: Developer working on the fix.
4. **Fixed**: Developer resolves the defect.
5. **Verified**: Tester verifies the fix.
6. **Closed**: Defect is resolved and closed.

---

### 6. **Test Strategy**

The overall test strategy will include:
- **Functional Testing**: Verify login functionality with valid/invalid credentials.
- **Security Testing**: Check for password hashing and encryption.
- **Usability Testing**: Ensure responsiveness across devices and browsers.
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate multiple users logging in simultaneously.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
